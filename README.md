# Blogging Website (Frontend Project)

### Overview  
This project is a fully responsive **Blogging Website** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It provides a modern, minimal, and interactive platform where users can **create, search, categorize, and manage blog posts** — all directly in the browser using **localStorage** for data persistence.  

The website is designed to offer a clean reading and writing experience, focusing on simplicity and smooth user interaction without requiring any backend.

## Features  
- Create, publish, and delete blog posts dynamically.  
- Filter posts by category (Tech, Travel, Food, Lifestyle, etc.).  
- Real-time search functionality for quick content discovery.  
- Automatically saves all posts to **localStorage** (persistent across sessions).  
- Fully responsive design — optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
- Beautiful, modern UI with smooth animations and modal-based post creation.

## Project Structure  
- **HTML (new03.html):** Defines the structure and layout of the blogging website.  
- **CSS (new03.css):** Handles the design, layout, responsiveness, and visual aesthetics.  
- **JavaScript (new03.js):** Manages all interactive features, including adding, deleting, filtering, and saving posts dynamically.

## How It Works  
1. The homepage displays a **hero section**, a **search bar**, and a **category filter**.  
2. Users can click **“New Post”** to open a modal form and enter details like title, author, category, and content.  
3. The post is saved in **localStorage** and immediately appears in the “Latest Posts” section.  
4. Users can **search** for posts or **filter** them by category.  
5. Each post can be deleted instantly, updating both the UI and localStorage.
